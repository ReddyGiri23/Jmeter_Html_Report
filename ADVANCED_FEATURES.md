## 🎓 Understanding the Metrics

### Z-Score
A measure of how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.
- Z > 3: Significant anomaly
- Z > 4.5: High severity anomaly
- Z > 6: Critical anomaly

### R-Squared
Indicates how well the trend line fits the data (0 to 1).
- R² > 0.7: Strong trend confidence
- R² 0.4-0.7: Moderate trend confidence
- R² < 0.4: Weak trend confidence

### Correlation Coefficient
Measures relationship strength between two metrics (-1 to 1).
- |r| > 0.7: Strong correlation
- |r| 0.4-0.7: Moderate correlation
- |r| < 0.4: Weak correlation

### Performance Score Weights
- Response Time: 30% (most critical for user experience)
- Error Rate: 25% (reliability is crucial)
- Throughput: 20% (capacity and efficiency)
- Stability: 15% (consistency matters)
- Scalability: 10% (growth potential)
